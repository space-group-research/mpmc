This is a sample simulated annealing script for the MOF NOTT-112.
Two files are included.

input.pqr (1) contains the MOF with a single H2 molecule about 2.5A from
the CuC open metal site.

sa.inp (2) contains instructions for MPMC to run the annealing, starting from
40K and decreasing the temperature by a factor of 0.99999 each MC step. Pressure
is kept constant at 0.1atm.

S.A. generally takes less time than uptake simulations for several reasons:
	- Being an NVT model, the number of sorbate molecules is fixed (e.g. at 1)
	- The simluation need not 'equilibrate'; only run until a desired final 
	  temperature is reached.
